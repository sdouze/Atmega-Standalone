# Atmega Standalone 

In this repository you can learn how to use Atmega328 standalone without Arduino board.

Also you will find photos and schematics of my Atmega Board that I build on a prototype board.

Disclaimer:
This is a guide I wrote to document what I did to build my own "Arduino" board .
The guide contains my research about this topic and what I learned in the process of making the board.
